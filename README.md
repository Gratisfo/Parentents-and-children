# Parentents and children in russian drama
This is a repository for Bachelor thesis throughout the 2020/2021 academic year (Higher School of Economic, School of Linguistics). 

# About 
In this project, I conduct a contrastive analysis of parents and children' texts from Russian Drama Corpora ([its site](https://dracor.org/)). The first parent of work is the quantitative syntax, morphological, analysis and overal trends. The second part is machine learning tools for NLP: topic modeling and lexical complexity (as a plan). The third part is bulding few classificators based on features extracted on the previous steps and finding best of them.
